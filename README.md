I applied 3 different clustering algorithms on the given dataset and  visualized the clusters

I applied the below mentioned clustering algorithms to the given dataset.
After applying each algorithm I plotted the clustering graphs.

1. KMeans: Elbow method graph and clustering graph
2. Hierarchical Clustering: Dendogram and the clustering graph
3. DBSCN: Clustering graph
